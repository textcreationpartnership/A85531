            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Matters then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to come to a ripene≈ø≈øe, the Earle of <hi>Straford</hi> brought with him into that Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at his la≈øt going over, one Sir <hi>Toby Mathews</hi> an arch Je≈øuite, made him his Comrade, (ob≈øerved) none was more honoured by him then this grand Je≈øuite: Now ob≈øerve how ea≈øie a matter it is for a Je≈øuite once under≈øtanding the intent, to ≈øtate the hearts of other Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuites, Friers, Seminaries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then how ea≈øie a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 'tis for them to ≈øtate the hearts of all their people, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents, any man may judge that knoweth any thing.</p>
            <p>So then if the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> did ≈øhew him≈øelfe never ≈øo great a Tyrant (as certaine hee did) not only to the Natives, but al≈øo to the Britti≈øh; the rather to ca≈øt a cloud before the State of <hi>England</hi> then otherwayes; how ea≈øie it was for the Je≈øuites, Prie≈øts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to informe the Common people, that hee was for all their good, though hee ≈øhewed him≈øelfe otherwayes to them, as time hath brought it forth.</p>
            <p>Wee may now evidently ≈øee, what his Plott (with others was,) as I hope to produce ≈øuch conducing Circum≈øtances as may ≈øatisfie the hearts of all good Chri≈øtians, for others that are or may bee of the ≈øame faction, I leave, for who are blinder then they that will not ≈øee. A Mini≈øter who lived in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Kildare</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> had ≈øome Conference with a Popi≈øh Prie≈øt living not farre from him, who informed the Mini≈øter, of a Plott that was contrived beyond Sea again≈øt the Prote≈øtants in <hi>Ireland,</hi> relating that the Iri≈øh intended to ri≈øe ≈øhortly, and

The Mini≈øter finding the Prie≈øt ≈øerious, went along with him to the Earle of <hi>Straford,</hi> to the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> waited his opportunitie in the Gallerie, and at la≈øt pre≈øented this Prie≈øt to the ≈øaid Earle, expre≈ø≈øing that hee had informed him of a Plott the Papi≈øts had again≈øt the Prote≈øtants; the Earle an≈øwered, 'twas ≈øome bu≈øie-pated knave or other; being urged, he could ≈øay much, replyed; what could he ≈øay? the Prie≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken privately by the Earle to the further end of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, after halfe an houres ≈øpace was di≈ømi≈øt, there was given him by his Lord≈øhips Command, twenty pounds, a hor≈øe, and a ≈øuite of clothes to conceale the matter, and Commanded never to appeare againe, which according to his Commands was obeyed.</p>
            <p>Time began to draw on, the Earle of <hi>Straford</hi> was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to <hi>England,</hi> but before hee went was plea≈øed to expre≈ø≈øe, that if ever hee returned to regulate that honourable Sword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, hee would leave neither roote, nor branch, of the Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øh Nation in that Kingdome.

The Earle was taken notice of, and according to his merit was requited; Is this all? No, as now 'tis evident by the relation of ≈øome <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Je≈øuites, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that as ≈øoone as the ≈øtroake was ≈øtrooke by the Armies, betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> (which was to be about Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelma≈ø≈øe 1640.) the Earle of <hi>Straford</hi> was to returne for <hi>Ireland,</hi> then was it, that the Iri≈øh Armie being drawn down to the North as afore≈øaid, was to fall upon all the Inhabitants <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> thereabouts, and ≈øo the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> to fall upon all the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> Prote≈øtants in that Kingdome, but not to murther them in ≈øuch a ma≈ø≈øacring way, they only were to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their per≈øons and e≈øtates, till further order, and that they
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110930:5"/>were called to an accompt for their religion, and then refu≈øing, ≈øhould ≈øuffer.</p>
            <p>Their Plott failing in this particular, the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> waited on, as amazed, to ≈øee the i≈ø≈øue of their Earle (as they after tearm'd him) 'twas <hi>May</hi> following before his head was taken off, and after that, the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Armie was disbanded, which was no ≈ømall vexation to the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> (as may further appeare in the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Remon≈øtrance to his Maje≈øtie, that being their ≈øixt grievance) they mu≈øt then another way to worke, their agents being in <hi>England,</hi> they waited their return and taking their advantage of the yeare, after Harve≈øt, the 23. of <hi>October</hi> 1641. began their bloody ma≈ø≈øacre, <hi>Donnagh Mac Guire,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Eneskillings</hi> Uncle, and <hi>Hugh Mac Mahoune,</hi> the ≈øaid Lords Secretarie, and chiefe Coun≈øellour affirmed, that they ≈øhould have begun that time twelve-moneth, had the Lord of <hi>Straford</hi> returned accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to expectation; and al≈øo they expre≈øt, that there were the like di≈øtempers in <hi>England,</hi> and that Plott was for the three Kingdomes, and had the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Dublin</hi> beene taken, they would have ≈øent fourtie thou≈øand men to <hi>England.</hi> Being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed by the hearer, that he could not beleeve that the Earle had any hand in ≈øuch a bu≈øine≈ø≈øe; they affirmed hee had, and was to be Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as in former ages they had; and that they would not begin when they heard his head was off, but forbore till harve≈øt was in, and nights long, that they might ≈øet them≈øelves in a po≈øture of warre. For they well knew how ea≈øie it was in Summer, for <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> to ≈øend an Armie to qualifie them.</p>
            <p>Some notice may be taken of the Earles words before hee parted with his head, ≈øpeaking of a Reformation in Charracters of blood, and that there was a Cloud impending, which ≈øince hath proved too true to our wofull experience. (What will not ambitious Machavilians attempt to make them and their po≈øterity great.) Mo≈øt certaine it is by relation of tho≈øe that were about the Lord Amba≈ø≈øadour to <hi>Spaine,</hi> that about Michaelma≈ø≈øe 1640. the Je≈øuites, Prie≈øts, and Friers, in <hi>Spaine</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

There is no wonder in this, for all men that knew him, might quickly di≈øcerne his inclination to that Idolatrous, Babilonian whore.</p>
            <p>Now, ≈øince this ma≈ø≈øacring act it hath been frequently ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Rebells, that what they did was by Commi≈ø≈øion, which ≈øtill they ju≈øtifie. Let all Chri≈øtians ≈øtand here amazed to behold the ce≈ø≈øation of Armes to be granted to ≈øuch Butcherly Hell-hounds, who have wallowed and embrewed their hands in the de≈øtruction of at lea≈øt two hundred thou≈øand Prote≈øtants, of men, women, and children, which will be particularly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved if occa≈øion be offered.

            <p>There is one thing to be taken notice of that when the Lord of <hi>Ormond</hi> marched forth this la≈øt Summer 1643. with foure thou≈øand hor≈øe, and foot, kept the randevous at <hi>Curr</hi> in <hi>Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,</hi> when they might have done good execution again≈øt the Enemie were kept above a fortnight in the field and Starved above three hundered of them returned (though they ≈øaw the enemies Coulours flying in the field) taking only one poore old Ca≈øtle not worth a con≈øideration, then after that, they were di≈øperced by Companies (≈øome three thou≈øand of them) into ≈ømale Garri≈øons in the pall, to ≈øecure old Ca≈øtles; a weeke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Ce≈ø≈øation was concluded the Iri≈øh forces both of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter Connaught,</hi> and <hi>Vl≈øter,</hi> (they well knowing when to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Ce≈ø≈øation) joyned together and fell on the ≈øaid ≈ømall Garri≈øons, and de≈øtroyed many, and tooke divers pri≈øoners, po≈ø≈øe≈øt them≈øelves of a great part of <hi>Meath</hi> which ≈øtill they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy.

May we not now ob≈øerve in what a Cloud ≈øtill we are under, though faire ≈øhaddows are ca≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes; As that the new Lord Lievtenant Marque≈ø≈øe of <hi>Ormond,</hi> hath commanded that no Papi≈øt ≈øhall be either of his retinnue, or of his Companies, in his regiment and Guard, when it may be well ob≈øerved how forward he is to give way to Papi≈øts to be tran≈øported into England, to ≈øerve again≈øt the Prote≈øtants, as al≈øo tis worth a con≈øideration (that ≈øince the

            <p>This is a hard ca≈øe that Rebells ≈øhall have their rents paid them, and that many hundreds of us Prote≈øtants ruin'd (with their wives and children) in their e≈øtates by the Rebels, and are daily begging and ≈øtarving in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and other parts of that Kingdome (be≈øides tho≈øe that are forced to flie for ≈øuccour into other Kingdomes, and no reparation can be thought of, for the keeping them alive, out of their owne e≈øtates, enioyed now by the Rebells; whil≈øt our army was on foote (God ≈øo ble≈ø≈øed our poore handfull of men) that ≈øtill they had the better of the

            </p>
            <p>Now faire oppertunity may the Iri≈øh have to playe their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gaine, as they have ≈øufficiently envited and ≈øet forth in print from <hi>Waterford.</hi> Entituled, Admoni≈ø≈øions by the ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Coun≈øell of the confederate Catholicks of <hi>Ireland:</hi> To all his Maje≈øties faithfull, loyall Subjects of the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, of <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> again≈øt a ≈øolemne League and Covenant framed by the Malignant party, in the Parliament of <hi>England;</hi> as al≈øo a Declaration of the Engli≈øh Lords and Commons a≈ø≈øembled in Parliament wherein they en≈øite, not only their owne Nation to ≈øtand to their Arms of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fen≈øive and Defen≈øive, but envite them to a timely and a fit prevention; as al≈øo envite all Romi≈øh Catholicke Kings, to take notice how far they are engaged in it; as much as if they ≈øhould ≈øay to their Countrimen, play your after game, take a fit time to cutt all the re≈øt of the Prote≈øtants throats and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite other Princes to fall upon the Ma≈ø≈øacring of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants, within their verdge.</p>
            <p>Thus we find how active they are at the pen let us looke a little further, &amp; conclude what their intentions are, as doth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110930:7"/>appeare by their diligence, in ≈ølacking no time to ≈øet forward their intended project, how bu≈øie they (the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi>) have beene in procuring Armes and Ammunition ≈øince the Ce≈ø≈øation. Sir <hi>Pierce Crosbie,</hi> who about the time of Conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ce≈ø≈øation, brought over with him to <hi>Waterford,</hi> (for the Rebels) five thou≈øand Armes and Ammunition.</p>
            <p>Againe, the Popes <hi>Nuntio</hi> (who is there frequent with them (brought over Trea≈øure to maintaine the warre, as is ≈øaid fiftie thou≈øand pounds.</p>

            <p>To Conclude, now the <hi>Scotti≈øh</hi> Armie are re≈øolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as already appeares, three Regiments are wafted over into <hi>Scotland,</hi> (which maketh ≈øtill for the Iri≈øh) and to bring to a period their Je≈øuiticall Plott, ≈øo as the Iri≈øh may the better performe their offer to ≈øend away tenne thou≈øand of their chiefe Souldiers, under the Command of experienced Commanders, to keepe the Prote≈øtants in Armes in other Kingdomes, either in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland;</hi> Oh! that we might in ≈øome mea≈øure u≈øe the Pollicies of the Antient <hi>Romans,</hi> or of late Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of famous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie did, who when the Spaniards ≈øtrove to envade <hi>England,</hi> did afford ≈øome aide unto the <hi>Hollander</hi> to keepe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on worke at home, by which ≈øhe pre≈øerved her Kingdomes (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods Providence) from being a Seat of warre: So if time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevented by <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> to keepe the warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foote in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to prevent further mi≈øchiefe, (which is like to en≈øue, if the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> breake forth into other Kingdomes) and ≈øo turne the Sword into their owne bo≈øomes: which that wee may, the Lord of Ho≈øts enable us to doe.</p>
            <p>Here now it is manife≈øt that the <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> have obtained not only their fir≈øt reque≈øt de≈øired in their Remon≈øtrance, which was to have one placed in chiefe Authoritie, of Honour and Fortune, approved by His Maje≈øtie, and acceptable to the Rebells, (which proveth to be the Marque≈ø≈øe of <hi>Ormond</hi>) but al≈øo the other to have a free Parliament held there, and and an Act of oblivion to be made for their Rebellion; and <hi>Poynings</hi> Act to be repealed: and there the Rebells to hold their Parliament; which is reported His Maje≈øtie hath yeelded unto, by granting
